This is my Front-End Track, to study.

## ROAD MAP

I started my studies by following the Roadmap.sh Front-End roadmap to guide my studies.

## COD3R

To follow the concepts, i studied using the Web Moderno course from Cod3r, which allowed me to watch video lessons to complement the reading of other materials. It also allowed me to practice writing code, further consolidating my knowledge.
